          <p>Fapohunda Gbolahan Kehinde</p>
        </div>
          <P>Fapohunda Gbolahan Kehinde began his professional career as a business consultant while working
with Bode Fapohunda and Co. (Chartered Accountants, Business Advisory Services, and Financial
Consultant), a former Assistant General Manager of the then Nigerian Stock Exchange (now Nigeria
Exchange Group) between 1999 and 2014. During this period, he saw businesses that sprung up. He
saw businesses that expand from one line of business to another. A good example is Agroachem
Nigeria Limited. Bode Fapohunda and Co. were with Agroahem Nigeria Limited when it started in
1999 as a cocoa trader. Gbolahan assisted Bode Fapohunda and Co. in securing a loan for Agroachem
for the exportation of Cocoa Beans. The professional advice of the audit and consultancy firm helped
Mr. Akinniyi Johnson the CEO of Agroachem Nigeria Limited to apply for a Union Homes and
Savings Loans Limited loan for the erection of a hotel business in Osogbo which was named Leisure
Spring Hotels Limited around the period of 2004 and 2006. The success of the business saw its way
to managing Sunny Sky Hotel Limited in Ondo. Afterward, a branch of Leisure Spring Hotel Limited
became functional in Ondo. He then expanded into an Oil and Gas business named Novelty
Petroleum and Gas Limited at Osunjela, Osogbo outskirts in Osun State. The long and short of this
is that Mr. Akinniyi wouldn't have been where he is now if not for the professional advice of Bode
<p>Fapohunda & Co. of which I was a partner in the audit and consultancy.
After Gbolahan Fapohunda graduated from the Federal Polytechnic, Ede in Osun State in 2014, he
went for his compulsory National Youth Service Corp (NYSC) in Edo State from November 2014 to
October 2015.
There, he serves in many capacities from being the Secretary of Platoon 3 at the NYSC camp in Okada,
Edo State to becoming the Pioneer Head of Audit of NIFOR Community Development Service. Two
weeks before the completion of his NYSC, he got a job at Ephybrand Quarry Limited at Ogunmakin
in Ibadan as the Account Officer and Store Manager of the quarry from September 2015 to May 2016.
Before he got there, it was difficult for the CEO to make sales of N1 million per month. Two months
after he worked there, with the assistance of the members of the Management team of the quarry, he
was able to achieve a sales result of between N10 million and N13 million and assisted the Quarry
Manager in managing the operations of the quarry outfit. There was even a day in November 2015
when we recorded sales of more than 30 trucks that loaded quarry materials.</p>
<p>By the middle of 2016 in June, he moved back to Osun State and this time, Bode Fapohunda & Co.
had merged with Arioye Abayomi and Co. (Chartered Accountants and Tax Practitioners) to form a
synergy called Arifap Partnership Consults. While working with the synergized audit, tax, and
consultancy firm, he was engaged mainly in business consultancy and Tax Audit Services. During that
time, he and Musa Arioye worked together on several projects as Tax Audit Consultants. He was able
to fully execute the Tax Audit assignment of LAPO Microfinance Bank, Oduduwa University,
Western Gate Farms, Cleangate Securities, and other tax audit assignments. He also executes the
business plan and feasibility study report for a group of farmers and entrepreneurs such as Genkeh
International Services and his working relationship ended in October 2018.</p>
<p>He then moved to Aitech Investments Limited from April 2018 to December 2018 as the Account
Officer of the company. During this period, he acted in different capacities. Apart from being an
account officer, he was part of the Support Staff that executed the Life Skills and Attitude Orientation
Training of N Power Tech Beneficiaries for southwest Zone in Foursquare Gospel Church Camp,
Ogunmakin, Ogun State, and Life Skills and Attitude Orientation Training of N Power Build
Beneficiaries for South East Region in five states (Ebonyi, Anambra, Imo, Abia and Enugu) when he
toured the five states in South East for three weeks. As the Account Officer of the company, he
drafted the accounting system of the company from the scratch, he was in charge of the preparation
of staff payroll of the company, expense monitoring schedule to monitor the expenses daily, expense
report, Petty Cash Report, cash flow projections on behalf of the company, staff tax schedule and
remittance of same to the bank, pension schedule and remittance of same to the bank, Bank
Reconciliation Statements to reconcile the cash balance with a bank balance, Collection of cash and
execution of other bank transactions on behalf of the Chairman of the company, Preparation of
analytical cash book to classify bank transactions into subheads.</p>
<p>After his exit from Aitech, he began his business consultancy services. Before he got to Aitech, he
simultaneously became a freelance business plan writer. He now has the time to pursue his business
consultancy service career fully. He began offering a business plan writing service, research writing
service, and a financial consulting service on Fiverr where he is currently a Level 2 Freelance seller.
During that time, he met Dr. Samuel Sanusi when he was first offered a business proposal contract to
be done on behalf of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism on a World Heritage project to retrieve lost
artifacts of the Yoruba Nation and to construct a World Heritage Center where the Yoruba Nation in
the diaspora both home and abroad will be taught and be reminded of the norms, ideals, and culture
of the Yoruba Nation. He did the project and it was successful. He was also offered the opportunity
to work as a Business Development Manager of Wefarm Integrated Services, an online platform that
connects farmers and agro-processors with buyers to date.</p>
<p>Not quite long, he became the Pioneer Head of Accounts Division of Sunboh Vegetable Oil Mills
from February to July 2022. He is currently the CEO of Damfap Consults Limited</P>
